About this Dataset

This repository contains result and play-by-play data from 2010 to 2019 in R Dataset (:code:`.rds`) form. You can get the data straight from the Internet and this GitHub repository for the datasets that you'd like to use.

Note for Stage 2:
-----------------

All of the data files have been updated through the end of the current
regular season. You can find everything you need in these four files:

1. Stage2DataFiles.zip (this contains the same type of information as
   the DataFiles.zip did for Stage 1, but it now includes 2019 data as
   well)
2. MasseyOrdinals\_thru\_2019\_day\_128.zip (this contains the same type
   of information as MasseyOrdinals.zip did for Stage 1, but it now
   includes 2019 data as well). For the absolute latest version of the
   Massey Ordinals, see the Discussion thread "Massey Ordinals Day 133
   Thread".
3. PlayByPlay\_2019.zip (this contains the same type of information as
   PlayByPlay\_2018.zip, etc., but it is play-by-play for the current
   2019 season games)
4. SampleSubmissionStage2.csv (this has the proper number of rows, and
   the proper teams for the 2019 tourney only, which is all you predict
   in Stage 2)

You can just disregard the Stage 1 files and the Prelim files at this
point - they are completely superseded by the above release. The only
exceptions are that the play-by-play data for earlier years
(PlayByPlay\_2010, PlayByPlay\_2011, ..., PlayByPlay\_2018) is still
useful, and there will be ongoing releases of the latest Massey Ordinals
as they become available.
