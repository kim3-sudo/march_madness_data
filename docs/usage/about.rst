About this dataset
******************

Each season there are thousands of NCAA basketball games played between
Division I men's teams, culminating in March Madness®, the 68-team
national championship that starts in the middle of March. We have
provided a large amount of historical data about college basketball
games and teams, going back many years. Armed with this historical data,
you can explore it and develop your own distinctive ways of predicting
March Madness® game outcomes. You can even evaluate and compare
different approaches by seeing which of them would have done best at
predicting tournament games from the past.

We extend our gratitude to Kenneth Massey for providing much of the
historical data.

Special Acknowledgment to Jeff Sonas of Sonas Consulting for his support
in assembling the dataset for this competition.
